# Minimum-Spanning-Tree
Implements Kruskal's algorithm to produce a MST. 

Input: text file with lines consisting of four items: the *from* node (int), the *to* node (int), the name of the edge
given, and the edge weight.

Output: the list of edges in alphabetical order required to construct the minimum spanning tree, alongside the total edge weight.
